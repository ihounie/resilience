# Resilient Constrained Learning

Official implementation for the paper [Resilient Constrained Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02426).

Experiments are organized into two folders, each containing a README with instructions on how to run the experiments:

- `Federated` contains the code for heterogeneous federated learning.
- `Invariance` contains the code for learning under invariance.
